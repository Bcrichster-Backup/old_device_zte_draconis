Device configuration for the ZTE ZMAX (Z970)



SELINUX patch

the selinux is fail on default build, so i have to mark selinux as permissive by adding androidboot.selinux=permissive to kernel cmdline but system/vold is failing without a selinux context, so the following patch must apply to system/vold before build CM-13

cd system/vold
git am ../../device/zte/draconis/repack-boot-img/system_vold_do_not_abort_on_setexeccon_failure.patch

after build the CM-13, we also need to patch the boot.img before flash it to device

./device/zte/draconis/repack-boot-img/repack.sh
